## Introduction

Here we have an easy implementation of Langchain using with tesseract.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to extract data arrays in csv.
- Integration with OpenAI model for natural language processing functionalities.
- Simplified the proccess to get your information classified and in order.
- This project is an POC in order to show what it can be done with langchain.
